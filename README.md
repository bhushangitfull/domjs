Hi it is my first git practice for practicing git commands and github

commands in git

1. git add

2. git status #lists all new or modified files to be committed

3. git commit -m "commit-name"

4. git remote add origin "github url" # adds a remote repository to your local repository

5.git push -u origin master #push changes made in origin
